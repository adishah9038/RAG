What products have 0.1mg in them?,The products that have 0.1mg in them are the Moisture Analyzer with a precision of 0.005% and the Analytical Balance.
What is the range of the temperature setting for the device?,The temperature setting for the device is 40°C to 160°C.
Can you elaborate on the specifications and features associated with the analytical device classified under HSN: 90160020?,"The analytical device classified under HSN: 90160020 features E.M.F.C. Technology, a halogen heating system, and operates within a temperature range of up to 200°C. It has a capacity of 60g, with a readability of 0.1mg and a repeatability of ±0.1mg. The device also offers a linearity of ±0.2mg. The temperature setting can be adjusted from 50°C to 200°C in 1°C intervals, and it displays moisture content, time, temperature, and weight. The time setting ranges from 1 to 120 minutes in 1-minute intervals. It includes 10 aluminum sample pans, an RS232C interface, and operates within a temperature range of 10°C to 40°C. The power supply is AC 220V/50-60Hz, and the device dimensions are 330 x 200 x 155mm, weighing 5.5 kg."
Wht is the pan size of the device?,The pan size of the device is 90mm.
What is the maximum temperature for operating the device?,The maximum operating temperature for the device is 35°C.
"What are the operating temperature specifications for the analytical devices mentioned in the context, and how do they compare in terms of capacity and readability?","Both analytical devices mentioned in the context have an operating temperature range of 10°C to 40°C. The first device has a capacity of 600g with a readability of 0.01g (10mg), while the second device has a lower capacity of 200g and a higher readability of 0.001g (1mg)."
Wht are the power supply requirements for the halogen heating system and the multifunction weighing unit?,"The halogen heating system requires a power supply of AC 220V/50-60Hz, while the multifunction weighing unit uses a DC adaptor that also operates on AC 220V/50-60Hz."
"What is the difference in repeatability between the two weighing devices mentioned, specifically in terms of 0.02g and 0.2g?","The first weighing device has a repeatability of ±0.2g, while the second device has a repeatability of ±0.02g. This indicates that the second device is more precise in its measurements compared to the first."
What are the readability specifications for the analytical balance that can measure 0.1g and how does it compare to the 0.01mg moisture analyzer?,"The analytical balance has a readability specification of 0.1g (100mg), while the moisture analyzer can measure with a readability of 0.01mg. This means the analytical balance is less precise than the moisture analyzer, which can measure much smaller increments."
"What are the differences in readability and repeatability between the two analytical devices mentioned, specifically focusing on the values of 0.2 mg and 0.2g?","The first analytical device has a readability of 0.1g (100mg) and a repeatability of ±0.2g, while the second device offers a much finer readability of 0.01mg / 0.1mg (0.00001 / 0.0001 g) and a repeatability of ±0.02 / 0.2 mg. This indicates that the second device is capable of measuring much smaller quantities with greater precision compared to the first device."
