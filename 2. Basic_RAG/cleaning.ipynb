If Weighing Balance does not have Density function facility, DDK200 customers have to calculate manually. According to the Archimedean Principle, Solid Body immersed in a liquid apparently loses as much of its own weight as the weight of the liquid it has displaced. This makes it possible to determine the unknown value, depending on whether the body in question is liquid or solid. The international system of units specifies Kg/m³ as the unit of density. However, the unit g/cm³ is better suited for lab purposes.\n",
